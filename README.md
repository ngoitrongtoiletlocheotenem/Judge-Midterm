## 📖 What is an Online Judge?

An **online judge** is a system that:
1. Shows you a programming problem (like "add two numbers")
2. Lets you write code to solve it
3. Runs your code against test cases
4. Tells you if your solution is correct ✅ or wrong ❌

---

## 🎯 What Can You Do With This?

- ✅ Browse programming problems (Easy, Medium difficulty)
- ✅ Write code in **Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, or C**
- ✅ Submit your code and see instant results
- ✅ See which test cases passed or failed
- ✅ Practice coding in a beautiful dark-themed editor

## ▲ Deploy Frontend on Vercel

This repository now includes Vercel configuration:
- `vercel.json` for routing static pages
- `api/[...path].js` as an API proxy

### Important
Vercel hosts the UI and API proxy layer. Your Java backend must still run on a separate host (for example: Render, Railway, Fly.io, VPS).

### Steps
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import the repo in Vercel.
3. In Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables, add:
  - `BACKEND_URL` = your deployed Spring Boot base URL (example: `https://your-api.example.com`)
4. Deploy.

After deployment:
- `/` serves the problem list UI
- `/problem.html` serves the editor page
- `/api/*` is proxied to your Spring Boot backend via `BACKEND_URL`

---

## 🚂 Deploy the Backend on Render

Render should host only the Spring Boot API for this project.

### ✅ Persistent Database (Recommended)
To make problems survive restarts/redeploys, use the included Render blueprint with **both**:
- a Docker Web Service (`online-judge-backend`)
- a free PostgreSQL database (`online-judge-db`)

The blueprint wires database credentials automatically and enables the `render` Spring profile.

### Recommended: Docker Web Service
Use a **Docker Web Service** on Render so the backend has the compilers it needs to run submissions in `executor.mode=local`.

This repository includes a [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) blueprint and a [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for that setup.

The blueprint uses Render's free web service plan, so you should not be forced onto the paid Starter tier.

It also includes a free PostgreSQL instance so imported problems are stored persistently.

### If you prefer a Java Web Service
You can also configure a Java service manually with:

**Build Command**
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

**Start Command**
```bash
java -jar target/online-judge-1.0.0.jar
```

### Port Handling
Render provides the `PORT` variable automatically. The app is configured to use it via:

```yaml
server:
  port: ${PORT:8081}
```

### Vercel Connection
After Render deploys, copy your backend URL and set it in Vercel:

```text
BACKEND_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com
```

That gives you this flow:

Browser → Vercel frontend → Vercel `/api/*` proxy → Render Spring Boot backend

### Admin Import Endpoint

You can upload a whole problem set with one request:

```http
POST /api/admin/import
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example body:

```json
{
  "clearExisting": true,
  "problems": [
    {
      "title": "Add Two Numbers",
      "description": "## Problem Statement\nReturn the sum of two integers.",
      "difficulty": "EASY",
      "timeLimit": 1000,
      "memoryLimit": 128000,
      "testCases": [
        {
          "input": "3 5",
          "expectedOutput": "8",
          "isHidden": false,
          "orderIndex": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "problemsImported": 1,
  "testCasesImported": 1,
  "clearedExisting": true
}
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The main configuration file is `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

For Render production, this repo also includes `src/main/resources/application-render.yml`.

### Database Profiles

- `application.yml` (default/local): H2 in-memory database
- `application-render.yml` (Render): PostgreSQL with durable storage

On Render, the profile is enabled via:

```yaml
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=render
```

This is already set in [`render.yaml`](render.yaml).

### Changing the Execution Mode

Find this section in the file:

```yaml
executor:
  mode: local    # Change to 'docker' for Docker mode
```

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `local` | **Default.** Code runs directly on your computer. Faster but less secure. |
| `docker` | Code runs inside Docker containers. Slower but isolated and safer. |

### Changing the Port

The app runs on port **8081** by default. To change it:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081    # Change this number
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Local Mode
- ⚠️ Code runs directly on your machine
- ⚠️ Not recommended for untrusted code
- ✅ Great for personal practice

### Docker Mode
- ✅ Code runs in isolated containers
- ✅ Network is disabled (code can't access internet)
- ✅ Memory and CPU limits applied
- ✅ Safer for running untrusted code

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues

**"'python' is not recognized"**
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
- Restart your terminal after installation

**"'g++' is not recognized"**
- Install MinGW-w64 from [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
- Add `C:\mingw64\bin` to your PATH environment variable

### Linux/Mac Issues

**"Port 8081 already in use"**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 8081
fuser -k 8081/tcp   # Linux
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill  # macOS

# Then try again
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**"python3: command not found"**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3

# macOS
brew install python3
```

### Docker Issues

**"Docker: permission denied" (Linux)**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then log out and log back in
```

**Docker not starting (Windows)**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check that WSL2 is properly installed

### Java Issues

**"Compilation Error" when submitting Java**

Make sure your class is named `Main`:
```java
public class Main {  // ✅ Must be named Main
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // your code
    }
}
```

## 🤝 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
You write code    →    Server receives it    →    Code runs in sandbox
      ↑                                                    ↓
      └────────────────  Result sent back  ←──────────────┘
```

1. **You submit code** through the web interface
2. **Server saves** your submission to the database
3. **Code executor** (local or Docker) runs your code
4. Your code gets **test inputs** and produces **outputs**
5. **Outputs are compared** with expected results
6. You see **ACCEPTED** if all tests pass, or an error otherwise
